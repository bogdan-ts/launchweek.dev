**key takeaways**

Some learnings from this week:

Launch weeks are high peaks. You may want to maximize the compound effect and launch on more places — like Product Hunt. That's a strategy we applied at Bucket and so did Tinybird. We both launched on Product Hunt during launch week and made it a Battle Royale. Results? We both got featured in Product Hunt's newsletters and its 800,000+ subscribers.

Related: Pull in partners as much as possible. We may have reached a high level of engagement because of it.

Thank you and S/O to [Cameron Archer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cameron-archer-b047573b/) and team for the collaboration!

**fun fact**

We define a launch week as a week of announcing new features. It doesn’t have to last 5 days, though — it could last less or more.

Take Tinybird. Their Forward Launch Week lasted 7 days — the longest this year.

Every week is launch week. This week `W10` was Railway Launch Week 02.

Railway is an out-of-the-box git to deployment platform with auto-scaling, DBs, secrets, rollbacks, and more. 

Read their announcements here:

<Card title="Railway Launch Week 02" href="https://railway.com/launch-week-02">
  Out-of-the-box git to deployment platform
</Card>

**key takeaways**

From my perspective, it's key to announce your launch week in advance to raise awareness and start building momentum. Railway really nailed it. They announced their launch week two weeks in advance in their [changelog](https://railway.com/changelog/2025-02-21-railway-launch-week-march) and on socials. Later on, they shipped a beautifully crafted [landing page](https://railway.com/launch-week-02). Some companies take launch weeks seriously and they stand out.
