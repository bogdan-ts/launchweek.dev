**key takeaways**

One challenge when launching a new feature is to make sure it reaches the right audience.

In this blog post, Ant Wilson, Supabase's CTO and co-founder, puts it simply:

> **_You can launch a new feature many times over and always manage to reach people who either forgot, ignored, or just plain missed it the first few times._**
>
> — Ant Wilson, Supabase's CTO and co-founder, Supabase

As a workaround, the HTTPie team released one major update on Day 1 and spread out the news with feature highlights over the week.

**upcoming**

Two upcoming launch weeks next February:

- Morph, a Python-centric full-stack framework for building and deploying data apps
- SigNoz, an open-source observability platform

Fun fact? We've tracked 195 launch weeks run by 135 dev-first companies since 2021. Among them, only 10 companies have run 3 launch weeks or more: Supabase, Wasp, Highlight, Daytona, Memfault, Mintlify, Mux, Outerbase, Resend, Turso. Morph and SigNoz just joined the list.

## 03

This week `W03` was hectic with 5 launch weeks: Wasp's 8th launch week and first-ever launch weeks for Appsmith, Dub, Pylon, and Ragie.

Below are the announcements:

<Card title="Appsmith Advance Winter 2025 Launch Week" href="https://www.appsmith.com/blog/appsmith-launch-week-1">
    Open-source low-code apps platform
</Card>

</Card>
<Card title="Pylon AI Launch Week" href="https://x.com/search?q=from%3A%40usepylon%20AI%20Launch%20Week&src=typed_query&f=live">

<Card title="Wasp Launch Week 8" href="https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2025/01/09/wasp-launch-week-8">
    Rails-like framework for React
</Card>

**key takeaways**

Some learnings from this week:

- We define launch weeks as a week of announcing new features. It doesn't _have to_ last 5 days, though. Take Dub. Dub's launch week lasted 3 days.
- For most companies, Day 1 was the most impactful in terms of social engagement. Dub absolutely crushed it when announcing Dub Conversions (143.7K impressions).
- Related: Pull in customers and partners as much as possible. In the previous example, Dub may have reached this level of engagement because it featured partners like Stripe, Clerk, and Supabase.
