**key takeaways**

I really enjoyed how Knock launched. They announced their launch week one week in advance to start building momentum, crafted a stunning [landing page](https://launchweek.knock.app/), and successfully involved their team for engagement.

S/O to [Sam Seely](https://x.com/samseely), [Chris Bell](https://x.com/cjbell_), and team.
