Enjoy your week — and keep launching!

## 19 

This week `W19` was launch week at Azion and Nx.

Read their announcements here:

<Card title="Azion Launch Week" href="https://www.azion.com/en/launch-week/">
  Full-stack edge computing platform
</Card>
<Card title="Nx 21 Launch Week" href="https://nx.dev/blog/nx-21-release">

</Card>

**key takeaways**

Friendly reminder that a launch week doesn't _have to_ last 5 days. Take Azion. Their launch week lasted 3 days.

**fun fact**

We've tracked 51 launch weeks in the last four months. That's a +37.8% increase compared to 2024.

Keep launching!

## 18

This week `W18` was launch week at Daytona and Knock.

Read their announcements here:

<Card title="Daytona Create Launch Week 5" href="https://create.daytona.io/">
  Secure and Elastic Infra for Running Your AI-Generated Code
</Card>
<Card title="Knock Launch Week" href="https://launchweek.knock.app/">
  Notifications infrastructure
</Card>

**key takeaways**

I really enjoyed how Knock launched. They announced their launch week one week in advance to start building momentum, crafted a stunning [landing page](https://launchweek.knock.app/), and successfully involved their team for engagement.

S/O to [Sam Seely](https://x.com/samseely), [Chris Bell](https://x.com/cjbell_), and team.

**upcoming**

We haven’t tracked any launch week for next week. If you’re planning a launch week, make sure to [create an issue](https://github.com/supabase-community/launchweek.dev/issues) or [open a pull request](https://github.com/supabase-community/launchweek.dev/pulls) to get featured.
