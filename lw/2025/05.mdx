**key takeaways**

I really enjoyed how Knock launched. They announced their launch week one week in advance to start building momentum, crafted a stunning [landing page](https://launchweek.knock.app/), and successfully involved their team for engagement.

S/O to [Sam Seely](https://x.com/samseely), [Chris Bell](https://x.com/cjbell_), and team.

**upcoming**

We haven’t tracked any launch week for next week. If you’re planning a launch week, make sure to [create an issue](https://github.com/supabase-community/launchweek.dev/issues) or [open a pull request](https://github.com/supabase-community/launchweek.dev/pulls) to get featured.
