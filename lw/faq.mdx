This project tracks launch weeks across the dev tools space — a place for developers to discover great dev-first products and for founders to learn about launch weeks.

What's a launch week? What are the main benefits? What types of companies run launch weeks? Do you need to ship a new feature every day during a launch week? Is it an alternative to Product Hunt? How to recover?

Below are answers to frequently asked questions.

## what's a launch week?

It's a week where a company announces a new feature every day. [See examples here](/lw).

## what are the main benefits?

  > **_Launch weeks have been great for both aligning the team and getting traction within the community._**
  >
  > — Rory Wilding, COO, Supabase


  > **_Launch weeks are high peaks (...) They create buzz and excitement around the product._**
  >
  > — Zeno Rocha, CEO and co-founder, Resend


  > **_We did 3 launch weeks in 2024, and each one had a meaningful impact on every aspect of the business. If you're considering ever doing it – do it._**
  >
  > — Brayden Wilmoth, Founder and CTO, Outerbase

## what types of companies is it for?

    Both solo makers, early-stage and late-stage companies! Take the [Mega Launch Week](https://lweek.dev/mega) for example — when 22 developer-first companies launched together.

    Companies of different sizes participated, from solo makers (KeyHippo) to 100-person teams (Pinecone).

## do you ship new features every day?

    No. To quote Ant Wilson, CTO of Supabase:

> **_One of our learnings from previous launch weeks was to no longer ship to prod on the day of the launch itself (...) It's ideal to get all the major integrations done a week early._**
> 
> — Ant Wilson, CTO, Supabase

We define a launch week as a week of announcing new features.

    It doesn't _have to_ last 5 days, though — it could last more or less than 5 days.

    In 2024, the shortest launch week lasted 3 days.

    The longest? 6 days. It was Unkey’s Launch Week.

## is it an alternative to Product Hunt?

No. Product Hunt definitely _is_ a great place to launch dev-first products — a place where many launched successfully: Supabase, Resend, and Warp, to name a few.

This project is different thought for three main reasons:

1. It focuses on the dev tools space
2. Filtered out by default
3. Spam-free by design

## how do you recover?

By planning the next launch week.
